# scripts
These are most of the scripts I use on my Arch Linux machine.

Many of these scriptss are dependencies for my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bbugyi200/dotfiles) repository. As with my dotfiles, I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to create symbollic links from these scripts to the appropriate location on my filesystem (/usr/local/bin). This way, I can organize my scripts in separate directories the way I like but without the need to add arbitrary directories to my PATH. The exact stow commands I use to do this can be found in my [clinks](config/clinks) script.
